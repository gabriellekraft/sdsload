# sdsload

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of sdsload is to provide a fast and simple way to load all necessary packages at once for specified Statistical and Data Sciences courses at Smith College.

## Installation

You can install the development version of sdsload from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:
``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github"gabriellekraft/sdsload")
```

## Usage

Given a specified Smith SDS course number, the load_sds() function loads all packages associated with the course. It can optionally install any associated packages that are not already available in a user's R environment. 

```{r example}
library(sdsload)
load_sds("sds_192", install_missing = TRUE)
```
